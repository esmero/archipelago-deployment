# Installing Archipelago Drupal 9 on Windows 10/11

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 64-bit: Home or Pro version 21H2 or higher, or Enterprise or Education version 21H2 or higher (see Docker for Windows link below).
- Windows 10 64-bit: Home or Pro 21H1 (build 19043) or higher, or Enterprise or Education 20H2 (build 19042) or higher (see Docker for Windows link below).
- [Install Ubuntu on WSL 2](https://ubuntu.com/wsl)
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
- [Install Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- At least 10 Gbytes of free space (to get started)
- Some basic Unix/Terminal Skills
- 2-4 Gbytes of RAM (4 Recommended)

### Optional

- [Install Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Ubuntu comes with Git by default, but for a more full-featured way to work with Github, you can install this application.

Open the Docker Desktop app. The Docker service should start up automatically with a status showing when the service is up and running.

Open an Ubuntu Terminal session (type `Ubuntu` in the Windows Start menu).

Bring everything up to date: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

## Deployment

[Follow the steps for deployment in Ubuntu](ubuntu.md#step-1-deployment).
