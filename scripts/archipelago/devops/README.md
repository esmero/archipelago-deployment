# "Automatic" Deployment Shell Script

The script in this folder called `auto_deploy.sh` is a slight modification of the documented steps for deployment available in [this repository's main README](../../../README.md). You can run this script from the root of the project by doing the following:

1. Give execution permissions to the script:
  ```shell
  sudo chmod 700 ./auto_deploy.sh
  ```
2. Go to the root of the project, and run the script from there:

  ```shell
  cd ../../..
  ./auto_deploy.sh
  ```

The script will give some prompts for a few options for you to select.

## Optional but more fun if you add content
