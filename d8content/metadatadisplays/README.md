## Updated Metadata Display Entities/ Twig templates for [Archipelago 1.0.0-RC3](https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-deployment/tree/1.0.0-RC3)

All source files have .twig.html extensions

If you are installing Archipelago 1.0.0-RC3 for the first time following the README you already have these, but if you are updating from RC2 or any previous version and skipped the complete installation, and/or want to update your templates manually because you did customizations, you probably want to:

* Backup (copy to a local file the Twig Source) any Metadata Display Entities you have customized.
* Run the Install script first: 
  `docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'scripts/archipelago/deploy.sh'` 
  Note: This will add all the new ones and will keep your current ones untouched
* Now run the Update script or skip and do it manually (expert)
  `docker exec -ti esmero-php bash -c 'scripts/archipelago/update_deployed.sh'` :
* Manual (expert):
   - replace http://localhost:8001/metadatadisplay/ID where ID is the one you want to replace with the corresponding content of the file. Files are Named like each provided Metadata Display Entity Title plus `.twig.html` extension and Spaces replaced by a `_`.
  
## Where are these templates used? 

* Several Field Formatters (viewers) use as input IIIF Manifests generated by these. 
* Archipelago exposes also Metadata endpoints which can be configured to use any of template at 
`http://localhost:8001/admin/config/archipelago/metadataexpose`, per Content Type. 
* In specific, the GeoJSON one provides support for the new [Map Formatter](https://github.com/esmero/format_strawberryfield/blob/1.0.0-RC3/src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter/StrawberryMapFormatter.php ).
